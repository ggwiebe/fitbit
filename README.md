Fitbit API Stuff

## Objective
To support greater visibility & access of my Fitbit data for tracking and visualization.

## Overview
Start with OAuth2.0 security;
Move on to using the API for extracting ("exporting") the data.

### Pre-requisites - setup
i.  Use NPM to get and install the REQUEST package
ii. 

### Authorization
We will be using the code grant authorization profile, so there needs to be an application to which Fitbit will grant authorization.
1. create / register an application (at Fitbit.com); most of the information here is not physically validated (other than for structural correctness, e.g. http://somesite.com would work);
2. Take the Client ID and Client Secret from the registration and use them (along with all the URLs supplied) with the REST service that will be using OAuth2.0 authentication support;
